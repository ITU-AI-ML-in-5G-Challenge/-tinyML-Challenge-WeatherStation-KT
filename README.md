# -tinyML-Challenge-WeatherStation-KT
The primary goal of this project is to create an edge device capable of measuring weather 
parameters and using those parameters to predict the short-term forecast using an energy-efficient 
tiny ML model.

ESP 32 DEV kit board was used and weather predict files can be uploaded and  humidity temperature, wind speed , air pressure ,current raining statues data should supply from weather station
Every hour next hour forcast will be given.
